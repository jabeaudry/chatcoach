# ChatCoach

Truth be told, we're not the best presenters... Sometimes we cross our arms during the entire presentation, sometimes we start using lots of filler words. But we'd like to get better at it! Introducing: ChatCoach!

## About the Project
ChatCoach is simple. Click on 'Start' and present in front of your camera. After you're done, you'll be able to view stats and graphs based on all your skills. First, you'll get a ratio of the time you spent looking in all three directions: left, right and in the centre. You'll also know if you ever looked down at cue cards, or if you crossed your arms. Your audience wants your full attention and its through open body language and eye contact that you can achieve that. Finally, the application analyzes how often you use filler words so you don't have to. All the information is presented in separate graphs and then summarized on one page.
